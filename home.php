                    Speech recognition, or speech-to-text, is the ability of a machine or program
                    to identify words spoken aloud and convert them into readable text.
                    Rudimentary speech recognition software has a limited vocabulary and may
                    only identify words and phrases when spoken clearly.
                    More sophisticated software can handle natural speech,
                    different accents and various languages.
                    Speech recognition uses a broad array of research in computer science, 
                    linguistics and computer engineering.
                    Many modern devices and text-focused programs have speech recognition functions in them to allow for 
                    easier or hands-free use of a device<br>
